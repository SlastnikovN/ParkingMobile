# ParkingMobile

This project was developed as part of the hackathon "Urbaton". Our team was developing the third track.

Optimization of parking spaces

In cities with a large number of cars, there are regular problems with parking, availability of parking spaces, and their location.
As part of the task, participants will have to implement an effective tool for booking and tracking information about the availability of parking spaces.
